Building
========

If you want to use libpcl context switching (suggested),
you need to install

libpcl - GNU Portable Coroutine Library, currently v1.12

available at

http://www.xmailserver.org/libpcl.html


Run configure with following parameters:

./configure --with-pcl=<pcl_install_dir> --prefix=<your_lpel_install_dir>

and

make
make install

In order to build the LPEL backend for the S-Net runtime system,
you'll need to set the environment variable LPELROOT:

export LPELROOT=<your_lpel_install_dir>


Don't forget to (re-)run ./configure in your $SNETBASE directory.



Example
-------

I have installed pcl in the default system-wide installation dir.
To build LPEL, I use

./configure --with-pcl=/usr/local/ --prefix=/home/daniel/local/
make
make install
export LPELROOT=/home/daniel/local
