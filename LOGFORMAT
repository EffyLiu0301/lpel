There are two kinds of monitoring files: map files and log files.

Map files
---------
Map files records the mapping of all tasks among workers. Each line of the map file has the following format:
<line-no> [ NET-PATH ] <box-name> <worker-id>
NET-PATH: {: POS} *
POS: S<num> ... position within serial composition (indizes start with 1)
     P ... border line of parallel composition (parallel/collect)
     P<num> ... position within parallel compostion (indizes start with 0)
     etc.
<line-no> ...obsolete, will soon be removed
<box-name> ... the S-Net box name, or the type for an implicit entity
<worker-id> ... starts with 0; -1 indicates special threads


Log files
---------
Each worker has one log file recording scheduling events. Information of each event is represented by one entry in the log file. Each entry ends with "#". (This is because the efficiency of the monitoring framework. To be read easily, "#" can be replaced by "\n")
There are 2 kinds of events: worker events, task events.
- Worker events:
	+ Worker started: Entry = <timestamp> S
	+ Worker waited: Entry = <timestamp> W <waiting time>
	+ Worker ended: Entry = <timestamp> E
- Task events:
	+ Task blocked: Entry = <timestamp> <blocked by> <task id> <execution time> <stream trace> | <message trace>
	+ Task ended: Entry = <timestamp> Z <task id> <execution time> <create time> <stream trace> | <message trace>
<blocked by>: "I" =  task is blocked by input. "O" = task blocked by output
<execution time> execution time since the last dispatch

Stream trace: information of streams on which the task operates
<stream trace> = {<stream entry>; }*
<stream entry> = <stream id>,<mode>,<#items>,<flags>
<mode>: "r" = task reads from stream, "w" = task writes to stream
<#items>: number of messages read from/written to stream (depending on the mode)
<flags>:  Activity fags. If no fag is set, the pattern is '--- '.  The first flag ('? ' if set) indicates that the task is blocked on that stream. The second flag '! ' indicates, that reading/writing (dependent on mode) unblocked the task on the other side of the stream.The third flag '* ' indicates that items have been read/written to the stream.

Message trace: information of messages which task consumes/produces
<message trace> = {<message entry>;}*
<message entry> = <timestamp> <io> <message id>
<timestamp>: time at which the message is consumed/produced
<io>: "I" = message is an input (consumed by the task), "O" message is an output (produced by the task)
